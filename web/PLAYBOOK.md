# DigiSafe AI — Safety Ops Playbook

## Tone & Copy
- Empowering, calm, peer-to-peer coaching.
- Avoid blamey language; focus on agency (“Here’s how you can respond”).
- Mention women and girls explicitly; acknowledge African digital realities.

## Risk Thresholds
- **Score ≥ 80:** Low risk (celebrate habits, suggest mentoring others).
- **55–79:** Moderate (focus on prioritizing 2–3 actions, emphasize attainable wins).
- **< 55:** High (urgent tone + resource links, remind user to document evidence).

## Content Guidelines
- Never invent phone numbers; use phrasing like “Contact your local cybercrime unit or trusted NGO (e.g., Pollicy, Paradigm Initiative).”
- Cite helplines generically until localized data is available.
- Encourage documentation, legal/NGO partnerships, and emotional care simultaneously.

## Escalation Recommendations
1. **Evidence capture** – screenshots, timestamps, URLs, witness accounts.
2. **Platform actions** – report, block, privacy review, comment filters.
3. **Community alert** – allies, moderators, workplace/school leads.
4. **Professional support** – NGOs, legal aid, mental health practitioners.

## Incident Response Template
- What happened?
- What evidence do you have?
- Who do you trust to inform?
- What immediate safety actions will you take? (technical + emotional)
- When will you check back in?

## Partnerships
- **NGOs:** African cyber safety orgs for localized guidance.
- **Telcos/ISPs:** zero-rate assessments, promote 2FA SMS prompts.
- **Schools & Universities:** onboarding pack for digital citizenship programs.

## Localization Checklist
- Translate quiz prompts + recommendations (EN/FR/SWA first).
- Replace examples (e.g., mobile money, WhatsApp voice notes).
- Swap cultural references while keeping action steps intact.
